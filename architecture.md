# Architecture

__*we should we talk about microservices/component architecture and overall architectural goals?*__

We apply the RESTful web service principles to all kind of application components, whether they provide functionality via the Internet or via the intranet as larger application elements. We strive to build interoperating distributed systems that different teams can evolve in parallel.

An API should contain the complete business processes containing all resources representing the process. This enables clients to understand the business process, foster a consistent design of the business process, allow for synergies from description and implementation perspective, and eliminates implicit invisible dependencies between APIs.
