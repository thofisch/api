We apply the RESTful web service principles to all kind of application components, whether they provide functionality via the Internet or via the intranet as larger application elements. We strive to build interoperating distributed systems that different teams can evolve in parallel.

As long as the API has only one consumer, it's entire job should service that consumer. Make it RESTful, sure, but don't bend over backwards to meet some arbitrary ideal standard*
